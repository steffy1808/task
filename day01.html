    Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical
    goals, especially in a reproducible way.[1] The word technology can also
    mean the products resulting from such efforts,[2][3] including both tangible
    tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software.
    Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
